# Collision Evasion Maneuver (CEM) ÈÅø

## What is it? ü§î

Collision Evasion Maneuver (CEM) is an advanced ADAS feature that automatically steers the vehicle to avoid an imminent collision. While Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) can only apply the brakes, CEM can control the steering, braking, and acceleration to maneuver the vehicle around an obstacle.

## How does CEM work? üßê

The CEM system uses data from multiple sensors, including radar, lidar, and cameras, to create a detailed model of the vehicle's surroundings. When it detects an imminent collision, it:

1.  **Assesses the threat:** It assesses the severity of the collision and the potential escape routes.
2.  **Plans a maneuver:** It calculates an optimal trajectory to safely guide the vehicle around the obstacle.
3.  **Executes the maneuver:** It carries out the plan by controlling the steering, brakes, and throttle.

## CEM Testing üß™

Testing CEM is extremely complex because it involves many variables. The testing methods include:

*   **Simulation:** Simulation is used extensively to test the CEM algorithm in a wide variety of scenarios and environmental conditions.
*   **Closed-track testing:** Physical prototypes are used on test tracks to test the CEM system in a controlled environment.
*   **Shadow mode:** Shadow mode can be used to run the CEM system in real-world driving conditions without it actually controlling the vehicle. The system's decisions are then logged for analysis.

## Real-world example üåç

Imagine you are driving on a two-lane road and an oncoming car swerves into your lane. The CEM system can detect the imminent head-on collision and automatically steer your car onto the shoulder to avoid the crash, something that would not be possible with braking alone.
