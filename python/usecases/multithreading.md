# ðŸ§µ Usecase: Concurrent Tasks with `multithreading`

Imagine your program needs to download several files from the internet. If you do it sequentially, it will download one file, wait, download the next, wait, and so on. Most of its time is spent **waiting** for the network. This is called an **I/O-bound** task.

**Multithreading** is the perfect solution for this. It allows your program to start multiple threads of execution that can run concurrently. While one thread is "blocked" (waiting for a download to finish), another thread can run, making your application much more responsive and efficient.

## ðŸ¤” What Is Multithreading?

Multithreading is a technique where a single process can have multiple threads of execution. All threads within a process share the same memory space, which makes sharing data between them easy.

However, in Python, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time. This means multithreading in Python is **not for speeding up CPU-bound tasks**. For that, you need `multiprocessing`.

So, when do you use it?
**Use `multithreading` for I/O-bound tasks.** (e.g., web requests, database queries, reading/writing files).
**Use `multiprocessing` for CPU-bound tasks.** (e.g., heavy calculations, data processing).

## âœ¨ Why Is `multithreading` So Important?

*   **Responsiveness:** It keeps your application responsive. For example, in a desktop GUI app, you can run a long-running task in a background thread without freezing the user interface.
*   **Efficiency for I/O:** It dramatically speeds up programs that have to wait for many slow operations, like downloading multiple web pages simultaneously.
*   **Easy Data Sharing:** Since threads share memory, passing information between them is as simple as accessing a shared variable (but this comes with its own dangers!).

## ðŸš€ How Do I Use `multithreading`?

Let's explore the fundamental patterns.

### 1. Creating and Running a Basic Thread

The `threading.Thread` class is the fundamental building block. You give it a `target` function to run.

```python
import threading
import time

def download_file(filename):
  """A dummy function to simulate a file download."""
  print(f"Starting download of {filename}...")
  time.sleep(2) # Simulate waiting for the network
  print(f"Finished downloading {filename}.")

# Create two Thread objects
t1 = threading.Thread(target=download_file, args=("file1.zip",))
t2 = threading.Thread(target=download_file, args=("file2.zip",))

start_time = time.time()

# Start the threads (they will run concurrently)
t1.start()
t2.start()

# Wait for both threads to complete before moving on
t1.join()
t2.join()

end_time = time.time()

print(f"\nAll downloads finished in {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds.")
# This will take ~2 seconds, not 4, because the "waiting" happened in parallel!
```

### 2. The Dangers of Shared Data: Race Conditions

Because threads share memory, you can run into trouble if multiple threads try to modify the same variable at the same time. This is called a **race condition**.

```python
# --- DANGEROUS EXAMPLE ---
counter = 0

def increment():
  global counter
  for _ in range(100000):
    counter += 1

threads = [threading.Thread(target=increment) for _ in range(10)]
for t in threads: t.start()
for t in threads: t.join()

print(f"Final counter value (expected 1,000,000): {counter}")
# The result will likely be LESS than 1,000,000 because of race conditions!
```

### 3. Solving Race Conditions with a `Lock`

A `Lock` is a synchronization primitive that ensures only one thread can execute a piece of code at a time.

```python
import threading

counter = 0
lock = threading.Lock() # Create a lock

def safe_increment():
  global counter
  for _ in range(100000):
    with lock: # The 'with' statement automatically acquires and releases the lock
      counter += 1

threads = [threading.Thread(target=safe_increment) for _ in range(10)]
for t in threads: t.start()
for t in threads: t.join()

print(f"Final counter value with lock: {counter}") # This will be exactly 1,000,000
```
**Best Practice:** Any time you have multiple threads accessing a shared resource (like a variable or a file), protect it with a `Lock`.

### 4. The Easy Way: `ThreadPoolExecutor`

Managing many threads manually can be complex. The `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` provides a high-level interface that manages a pool of threads for you. It's the modern and recommended approach.

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import time

def download_file(filename):
  """A dummy function to simulate a file download."""
  print(f"Starting download of {filename}...")
  time.sleep(2)
  return f"Successfully downloaded {filename}"

files_to_download = ["file1.zip", "file2.zip", "file3.zip", "file4.zip"]

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
  results = executor.map(download_file, files_to_download)

  for result in results:
    print(result)
```
The `ThreadPoolExecutor` handles starting the threads, collecting the results, and joining them, making your code much cleaner.
