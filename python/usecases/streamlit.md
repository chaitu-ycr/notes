# 🚀 Usecase: Building Web Apps with `streamlit`

You've written a Python script to analyze a dataset, visualize some results, or make predictions with a model. Now, how do you share it? You could ask people to run your script, but a web app is much more user-friendly. The problem is, building web apps is usually complex.

**Streamlit** changes everything. It's an open-source Python library that makes it incredibly simple to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. If you can write a Python script, you can build a Streamlit app.

## 🤔 What Is Streamlit?

Streamlit is a framework that lets you build interactive web applications using only Python. You write a standard Python script, and Streamlit renders it as a web app.

The magic of Streamlit lies in its execution model: **every time a user interacts with a widget (like moving a slider or clicking a button), the entire script reruns from top to bottom.** This simple model means you don't have to think about front-end/back-end communication, state management, or callbacks. You just write your script as if it were a simple, linear data analysis.

## ✨ Why Is Streamlit So Popular?

*   **Insanely Fast to Build:** You can turn a data script into a web app in minutes, not days.
*   **No Web Dev Experience Needed:** You only write Python. Streamlit handles generating all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
*   **Interactive Widgets:** It comes with a rich set of widgets for user input, which are as easy to use as calling a function.
*   **Data-Centric:** It's designed by data scientists for data scientists. Displaying dataframes, plots, and media is incredibly simple.
*   **Instant Deployment:** With services like Streamlit Community Cloud, you can deploy your app for free with just a few clicks.

## 🚀 How Do I Build a Streamlit App?

Let's build a simple, interactive data exploration app.

### 1. Installation

First, you need to install the library.
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas
```

### 2. Create Your Script

Create a Python file, for example, `my_app.py`.

### 3. Build the App

Let's build an app that lets a user upload a CSV file, select a column, and view a histogram of that column's data.

```python
# my_app.py
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# --- App Title and Description ---
st.title("📊 Simple Data Explorer")
st.write("Upload a CSV file, and this app will let you explore it.")

# --- File Uploader ---
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a CSV file", type="csv")

# --- Main Logic ---
# The rest of the script only runs if a file has been uploaded.
if uploaded_file is not None:
    # Load the data
    # @st.cache_data makes sure this only runs once per file upload
    @st.cache_data
    def load_data(file):
        return pd.read_csv(file)

    df = load_data(uploaded_file)

    st.header("DataFrame")
    st.write(df)

    # --- Interactive Widgets in the Sidebar ---
    st.sidebar.header("Options")

    # Allow user to select a column
    columns = df.columns.tolist()
    selected_column = st.sidebar.selectbox("Select a column for the histogram", columns)

    # Allow user to select the number of bins for the histogram
    # The value from the slider is automatically passed to the variable
    num_bins = st.sidebar.slider("Number of bins", min_value=5, max_value=50, value=20)

    # --- Display the Plot ---
    st.header(f"Histogram of {selected_column}")

    # Create the histogram
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.hist(df[selected_column], bins=num_bins)

    # Display the plot in Streamlit
    st.pyplot(fig)
```
*Note: You would need to install `matplotlib` (`pip install matplotlib`) for the plotting part.*

### 4. Run the App

To run your app, go to your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:
```bash
streamlit run my_app.py
```
Your web browser will automatically open with your new application running. Every time you move the slider or select a new column, Streamlit will automatically rerun the script and update the web page. It's that simple!
