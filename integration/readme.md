# ‚öôÔ∏è Integration: Connecting the Pieces

Welcome to the Integration section! In modern software development, writing code is only one part of the puzzle. **Integration** is all about the tools and processes we use to bring everything together. This includes:

*   **Version Control:** Tracking changes to our code.
*   **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically building and testing our code.
*   **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Automatically deploying our code.
*   **Configuration & Diagrams:** Defining our applications and infrastructure as code.

This section contains detailed guides on some of the most important tools and technologies in the integration landscape.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies in this Section

Here are the topics covered in this section. Each one has a detailed, beginner-friendly guide.

### [üêô Git](../GIT/readme.md)
The world's most popular version control system. This guide covers everything from your first `git init` to advanced topics like branching, merging, and rebasing. It's the foundation of modern software collaboration.

### [ü§ñ GitHub Actions](../Github_Actions/readme.md)
A powerful and flexible CI/CD platform built right into GitHub. This guide shows you how to automate your workflows, from running tests on every pull request to deploying your application to the cloud.

### [ü§µ Jenkins](../Jenkins/readme.md)
The original open-source automation server. This guide introduces the modern "Pipeline as Code" approach using a `Jenkinsfile`, allowing you to define powerful and flexible CI/CD pipelines.

### [üå± PlantUML](../PlantUML/readme.md)
Create beautiful diagrams from simple text! PlantUML is an amazing tool for creating and version-controlling diagrams like sequence, class, and mindmaps directly alongside your code. This guide walks you through the basics and a practical tutorial.

### [üìù YAML](../YAML/readme.md)
The human-friendly configuration language. YAML is the syntax behind many modern tools, including GitHub Actions and Docker Compose. This guide breaks down the syntax and provides a step-by-step tutorial for building a practical config file.
