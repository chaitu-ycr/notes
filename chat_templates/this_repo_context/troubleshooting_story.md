**Date:** `YYYY-MM-DD`
**Component:** `[Component Name]`
**Severity:** `[Low/Medium/High/Apocalyptic]`

## 🎬 The Scene (The Symptom)
*Set the stage. Make it dramatic.*
> "It was a dark and stormy Friday afternoon. The deployment pipeline was green, but the production server was screaming 500 errors like a banshee."

**The Error Message:**
```text
[CRITICAL] ConnectionRefusedError: The computer said 'No'.
```

---

## 🕵️ The Investigation
*How did you track it down? What were the red herrings?*

1.  **Hypothesis 1:** It's the database.
    - *Test:* Checked DB logs.
    - *Result:* DB is sleeping like a baby. ❌
2.  **Hypothesis 2:** It's the firewall.
    - *Test:* Pinged the server.
    - *Result:* Pong! ❌
3.  **The "Aha!" Moment:**
    - "I realized that the config file was pointing to `localhost` but the app was running in a container!" 💡

## 🛠️ The Fix
*Show the diff or the code change.*

```diff
- DB_HOST = "localhost"
+ DB_HOST = "host.docker.internal" # Or the actual service name
```

---

## 🧠 The Lesson
*What did we learn so we don't do this again?*
- **Takeaway:** Always check your environment variables in Docker.
- **Prevention:** Added a startup check to validate DB connection before launching the app.

> [!TIP]
> "It's always DNS. Except when it's Docker networking."
